# Training on WOMD

## Training a single experiment

To run a training experiment:
```bash
uv run -m scenetokens.train model=[model_name]
```
where `model_name`: either of `wayformer`, `scenetransformer`, `scenetokens_student`, `scenetokens_teacher`, `scenetokens_teacher_unmasked`, `safe_scenetokens`, `mtr` or `autobot`. The model name needs to be specified.

Additional command line arguments:
* `logger`: either of `mlflow`, `neptune`, `tensorboard`, `wandb`, `csv` or `many_loggers` (which will use both `mlflow` and `csv`). Specific parameters might need to be set for some loggers. **Default** value is `many_loggers`.
* `scenario`: either of `waymo` or `nuscenes`. This will simply set the scenario sequence partition. **Default** value is `waymo`, which will partition the scenario into 1.1 seconds of history and 8 seconds for prediction.
* `paths`: either of `waymo`, `causal_agents`, `safeshift`, `safeshift_causal`, or `ego_safeshift_causal`. Each specifies the paths to the train/val/test data. **Default** value is `waymo`.
* `trainer`: either of `cpu`, `ddp`, `gpu` or `mps`. **Default** value is `gpu'.
* `dataset`: This specifies the input data representation. Currently, the only supported value is `waymo`. See this [doc](./DATA_PREPARATION.md) for more details on how to prepare the data.


## Logging Details

#### CSV (Default)
Outputs will be saved to `out/logs/runs/date/experiment_name/csv`.

####  MLflow (Default)
Currently, it needs **tracking_uri** specification, as:
```bash
uv run -m scenetokens.train model=wayformer logger.mlflow.tracking_uri=[uri]
```

#### Tensorboard
To visualize logs:
```bash
uv run tensorboard --logdir out/ --host [host-address] --port [port]
```

#### Other
The other loggers (`neptune`, `wandb`) have not been configured yet, but have pytorch-lightning support. See this [link](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api_references.html#loggers) for reference.

## Evaluating a single experiment
To run an evaluation, specify any additional config arguments as above and a checkpoint name.
```bash
uv run -m scenetokens.eval ckpt_path=/path/to/the/ckpt.pth model=[model_name]
```

## Debugging
There are various debugging configurations which can be enabled by adding `debug=[debug_name]` to the command, where `debug_name` is either of:
* `default`: runs one epoch on debug mode on cpu.
* `fdr`: runs 1 train, 1 validation and 1 testing step.
* `limit`: runs n epochs with 1% of the training data dn 5% of the val/test data.
* `overfit`: runs n epochs to overfit on b batches.
* `profiler`: runs a performance profiler experiment.

Example, running the profiler:
```bash
uv run -m scenetokens.train model=wayformer debug=profiler
```

# Multirun training (Parameter Sweeps)

To run a sweep of experiments use `-m` and specify in the command line the parameter(s) to be sweeped. For example:
```bash
uv run -m scenetokens.train -m model=[model_name] model.config.num_classes=10,20,50,100
```
This will launch 4 sequential experiments where the value `num_classess` will be set to 10, 20, 50 and 100, respectively. The experiment logs will be saved to `out/logs/multiruns` instead of `out/logs/runs/`.

# Model types

- *SceneTransformer* (`model=scenetransformer`): follows the architecture from [AmeliaTF](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaTF/).
- *Wayformer* (`model=wayformer`): follows the architecture from [UniTraj](https://github.com/vita-epfl/UniTraj).
- *ScenetokensStudent* (`model=scenetokens_student`): builds from Wayformer and adds a scenario tokenization layer.
- *ScenetokensTeacher* (`model=scenetokens_teacher`): builds from Wayformer and adds a scenario tokenization layer with causal awareness.
- *ScenetokensTeacherUnmasked* (`model=scenetokens_teacher_unmasked`): ablation of *ScenetokensTeacher* without masking.
- *AutoBot* (`model=autobot`): follows the architecture from [Girgis et al., ICLR 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00563), adapted from [UniTraj](https://github.com/vita-epfl/UniTraj). Implements multi-modal trajectory prediction with factorized temporal and social attention.
- *MTR* (`model=mtr`): follows the architecture from [Shi et al., NeurIPS 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13508). Implements multi-modal trajectory prediction with a PointNet polyline encoder, a global transformer, and intention-point-conditioned motion queries. On the first training run, intention points are automatically computed from the training data and cached to disk.
- *SafeSceneTokens* (`model=safe_scenetokens`): builds from Wayformer and adds a scenario tokenization layer with safety-relevance awareness. Requires additional labels produced using the [ScenarioCharacterization](https://github.com/navarrs/ScenarioCharacterization) tool. Pre-generated meta files are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GlA768lIIFl3Zitxh00D9zH1Xmvj9mbQ?usp=drive_link). To produce training labels from these files, set `autolabel_agents=true` in `configs/train.yaml` (also set `overwrite_cache=true` if training data has already been post-processed).
